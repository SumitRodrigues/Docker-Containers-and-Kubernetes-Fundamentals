- Delete Images with Docker desktop
- Delete container with Docker desktop
- Delete operation with terminal and cmd
- Delete image and container forcefully

# Question:- Why should we delete?
-> You cannot update an image ever, you can create new image but the existing image should be deleted always because its in read-only mode and can 
never be updated.Hence, in order to save space and performance of local system we should delete the previourly created images.
- If your image is being used in any container than you cannot delete it directly from the docker desktop. So in order to delete the image that is
being used, you must first delete the container thats using the image and then once the status of the image becomes "unused" then you can delete the
image.

- docker image rm basic-app => terminal command to delete an image that is  "unused" status
- ocker image rm basic-app -f => to delete image that is "in use" status (forcefully)
- docker ps -a => to get all the containers
