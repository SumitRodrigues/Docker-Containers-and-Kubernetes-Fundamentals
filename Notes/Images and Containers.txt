Images:- are templates of projects

Docker Images:
- It is kind of ready to use software read only template
- Image is made with source codes, libraries, external dependencies, and tools.
- Images cannot be updated
- If you want to make change in image you have to create new image
- Images cannot run directly

Images Example:
- Application tools and libraries:
-> Node JS Setup
-> React Setup
-> Code of Application
-> Dependencies
-> Any other supporting tools
-> docker file too
- We can say that image is a template of project.



Container:- Running instance of image

- Runnable instance of image

Project Image => Run => Container

- The container is a process that runs applications with images
- Container is an isolated process -> Independent of any other software present on the machine
- Means Container run independently on computer
