- Images can be download with terminal or Docker Desktop
o Download Node image from Docker Hub
o Make a container for NodeJS
o Run NodeJS Container
o Write NodeJS code inside container

- docker pull node (command to get the node js image)
- docker run -it node /bin/bash (command to run the image)

- when you see that in the Docker desktop in the image section created 9 days ago that means someone made the changes on the original NodeJS image 9 days ago.
