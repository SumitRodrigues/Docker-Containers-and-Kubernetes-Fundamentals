A Comprehensive Glossary of Kubernetes Cluster Components
Location in Cluster: Control Plane

- Cloud Controller Manager: Connects a Kubernetes cluster to a cloud provider's API, managing cloud-specific resources and ensuring proper 
integration with the underlying infrastructure
- etcd: A key-value store that saves all data about the state of the cluster; only the kube-apiserver can communicate directly with etcd
- kube-apiserver: The kube-apiserver is a key component of Kubernetes that exposes the Kubernetes API, handles most requests, and manages 
interactions with the cluster by processing and validating API requests, making it essential for the cluster's operation
- kube-controller-manager: Monitors the Kubernetes cluster's state, running processes to ensure the current state matches the desired 
state
- kube-scheduler: Identifies a newly created pod that has not been assigned a worker node and assigns it to a specific node
- Location in Cluster: Worker Nodes 

- Container Runtime: Pulls container images, creates and manages containers, and ensures they run properly and securely as directed by the
 Kubernetes control plane
- kube-proxy: A network proxy that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster, maintaining network rules and enabling communication between
 pods and services within the node and the control plane, while also communicating directly with the kube-apiserver
- kubelet: An agent that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring containers in a pod are running and healthy while 
communicating with the API server in the control plane to maintain the desired state of the node
