Security Context: This is a set of security settings that you can apply to a pod or container. It includes configurations like running 
containers as non-root users, disabling privilege escalation, and making the file system read-only. These settings help prevent 
unauthorized access and modifications.

Non-root User: Running containers as non-root users means that even if someone gains access to the container, they won't have root 
privileges to execute harmful commands. This is a critical security measure to limit potential damage.

Read-only Root File System: Setting the root file system to read-only ensures that no changes can be made to the file system, preventing
 malicious actors from installing new software or altering existing files.

Snyk: A security tool used to scan Kubernetes YAML manifests for vulnerabilities. It helps identify and fix security issues in your 
infrastructure as code files. The video demonstrates using Snyk's CLI tool to scan a deployment YAML file and highlights the importance 
of addressing identified issues.

Liveness Probe: A Kubernetes feature that checks if an application is running. If the application fails the liveness probe, Kubernetes 
will restart the container. Although not covered in detail in this course, it's mentioned as a low-severity issue when missing.

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures): A list of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Following the open CVE page 
helps you stay informed about known Kubernetes security flaws and their fixes.

Kubernetes Hardening Guide: A guide released by the US National Security Agency (NSA) that provides best practices for securing 
Kubernetes clusters. The guide is regularly updated with new insights and recommendations.


These terms and practices are essential for securing your Kubernetes clusters and protecting them from potential threats.
