"Kubernetes worker nodes" video:

Kubernetes Worker Nodes: These are the busy terminals of a Kubernetes cluster where pods are scheduled and run. A typical cluster has at 
least three worker nodes for high availability.

Kubelet: An agent that runs on every worker node. It ensures that the containers in a pod have started running and are healthy. 
The Kubelet communicates directly with the API server in the control plane, looking for newly assigned pods.

Container Runtime: This is the software that runs containers. Once the Kubelet has been assigned a new pod, it starts the container(s) 
using the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). The CRI enables the Kubelet to create containers with engines like containerd, CRI-O, Kata 
Containers, and AWS Firecracker. Note that as of Kubernetes v1.24, the Dockershim was removed, so the Docker engine can no longer be 
used as a container runtime, although Docker images still work.

Kube-proxy: This component ensures that your pods and services can communicate with other pods and services on nodes and in the control 
plane. Each Kube-proxy communicates directly with the Kube-API server.


These components work together to ensure the smooth operation and communication within a Kubernetes cluster.
