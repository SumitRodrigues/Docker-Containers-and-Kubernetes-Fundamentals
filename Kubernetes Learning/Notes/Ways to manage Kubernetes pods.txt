Deployments: The most common way to deploy containerized applications in Kubernetes. Deployments allow you to control the number of 
replicas running. When deploying a new version of your application, Kubernetes can keep the old version running, roll out the new version
, ensure the new pods are healthy, and then remove the old pods. This process ensures a no-downtime upgrade.

DaemonSets: Used to ensure that a copy of a specific pod runs on every node in the cluster. DaemonSets are typically used for running 
background processes or agents on each node, such as monitoring or logging agents that collect metrics about the underlying node and 
other pods on that node.

Jobs: Create one or more pods and run the container inside them until the task is successfully completed. Jobs are suitable for tasks 
that need to be run once or periodically, such as generating a batch of data for a testing framework. Once the task is completed, the 
job can be deleted.


These methods provide different ways to manage and deploy pods in a Kubernetes cluster, each suited for specific use cases.
