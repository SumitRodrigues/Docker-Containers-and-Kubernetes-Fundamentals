Stateless Application: An application that does not retain any data or state between different sessions or requests. The sample 
application mentioned earlier in the course was stateless.

Stateful Application: An application that retains data or state between different sessions or requests. This requires persistent storage.

External Database: A database that runs outside of your Kubernetes cluster. For example, you can use a managed database service like 
Azure SQL, Amazon RDS, or Google Cloud SQL. This database can be configured to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster.

Kubernetes Persistent Volume (PV): A type of data storage that exists within your Kubernetes cluster. Persistent Volumes remain even 
after a pod is destroyed, ensuring data persistence.

StatefulSet: A Kubernetes object used to manage stateful applications. It ensures that each pod has a unique, stable network identity 
and persistent storage, allowing the application to communicate with the same volume even after the pod is updated or replaced.


These terms and concepts are crucial for understanding how to handle data storage in Kubernetes, particularly for stateful applications.
