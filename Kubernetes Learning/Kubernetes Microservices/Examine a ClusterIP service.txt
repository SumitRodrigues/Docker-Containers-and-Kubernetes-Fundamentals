Recap: You've learned about application deployment history, spun up a local cluster, deployed microservices, and explored Kubernetes service types.

Objective: Make an HTTP GET request to a ClusterIP service within the Kubernetes cluster.


Steps:
BusyBox Pod:

Purpose: Use BusyBox for making HTTP requests within the cluster.
Commands:
Create BusyBox pod: kubectl apply -f BusyBox.yaml
List pods: kubectl get pods
Access BusyBox pod: kubectl exec -it BusyBox -- /bin/sh


Find Pod IP Address:

Command: kubectl get pods -o wide
Note: Identify the IP address of the Learning Resources pods.

Make HTTP Request to Pod:

Command: wget -O- <Pod_IP>:3000
Result: JSON payload from the Learning Resources Service.

Make HTTP Request to Service:

Command: wget -O- LearningService
Result: JSON payload without needing the specific IP address.

Service DNS Name:

Format: http://<service_name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
Command: wget -O- http://LearningService.default.svc.cluster.local
Result: JSON payload using the service DNS name.


Key Points:
ClusterIP: Only accessible within the cluster.
BusyBox: Useful for debugging and making HTTP requests.
Service Discovery: Kubernetes resolves service names to IP addresses, simplifying communication.
