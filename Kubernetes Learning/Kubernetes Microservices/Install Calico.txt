Default CNI Plugin (Kindnet): Minikube's default CNI plugin is Kindnet, which is simple and only assigns IP addresses to pods. However, 
it does not support network policies.

Why Install Calico: Calico is a more complex and feature-rich CNI plugin that supports container networking, network security, and 
monitoring. It is chosen to give you experience with a more advanced CNI that supports network policies.

Installation Process:

Delete Existing Cluster: Run the command minikube delete -p demo to delete your existing cluster.
Start New Cluster with Calico: Run the command minikube start --network-plugin=cni --cni=calico -p demo to start a new cluster with 
Calico as the CNI.
Verify Installation: Use the command kubectl get pods -A to check for the calico-kube-controllers and calico-node pods. Once these pods 
are running, the installation is complete.

Calico Features: Calico provides container networking, network security, and monitoring features. It is a popular open-source project 
and is more resource-efficient when using Minikube's built-in version.

Next Steps: After installing Calico, you will learn how to deploy example microservices in your cluster.
