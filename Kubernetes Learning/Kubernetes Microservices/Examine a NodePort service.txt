Overview: The NodePort service exposes a group of pods directly to the internet by opening a port on one or more nodes.

Steps:
Accessing the NodePort Service:

Command: kubectl exec -it busybox -- sh to access the BusyBox pod.
Retrieve Pod IPs: kubectl get pods -o wide to get the IP addresses of the echo-server pods.

Make a Request to Pod IP:

Command: wget -O- <Pod_IP> to make a request to the pod IP address.
Note: Directly accessing pod IPs is not recommended as they change frequently.

Make a Request to Node IP and Port:

Retrieve Node IP: kubectl get nodes -o wide to get the IP address of the node.
Check NodePort: Look at the YAML manifest to find the NodePort or let Kubernetes assign one.
Command: wget -O- <Node_IP>:<NodePort> to make a request to the node IP and NodePort.

Make a Request to Service Name:

Command: kubectl get svc to get the service name.
Request: wget -O- echo-service to make a request to the service name.

Make a Request Using DNS Name:

Format: http://<service_name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
Command: wget -O- http://echo-service.default.svc.cluster.local to make a request using the DNS name.


Key Points:
NodePort Service: Exposes pods to the internet by opening a port on nodes.
BusyBox Pod: Used to make HTTP requests within the cluster.
Service Discovery: Kubernetes resolves service names to IP addresses, simplifying communication.
