Setup Recap: Previously, you installed and started a Minikube cluster with Calico as your CNI.

Deploying Backend Services:

Directory and Files: Navigate to the 0203 directory where you will find two YAML files: LearningResourcesAPI.yaml and EchoServer.yaml.
Learning Resources API:
Deployment: The LearningResourcesAPI.yaml file defines a deployment named Learning Resources with three replicas (pods).
Service: It also defines a service named Learning Service, which is a ClusterIP service.

Echo Server:
Deployment: The EchoServer.yaml file defines a deployment named Echo Server with two replicas.
Service: It defines a service named Echo Service, which is a NodePort service.


Commands to Deploy:

Deploy Learning Resources API:
Run the command: kubectl apply -f LearningResourcesAPI.yaml
Kubernetes will confirm that the deployment and service were created.

Deploy Echo Server:
Run the command: kubectl apply -f EchoServer.yaml
Kubernetes will confirm that the deployment and service were created.


Verify Deployments:

Check Pods:
Run the command: kubectl get pods
Ensure that the pods for both Echo Server and Learning Resources are running.

Check Services:
Run the command: kubectl get svc
Verify that the services Echo Service, Kubernetes, and Learning Service are running in the default namespace.


Next Steps: In the next chapter, you will learn what each backend service does and then deploy a frontend service.
