Container Network Interface (CNI) Project:

CNI plugins make networking in a Kubernetes cluster possible by addressing four key issues:
Containers must communicate with other containers in the same pod.
Pods must communicate with other pods.
Pods must communicate with services.
Traffic from the internet must communicate with services inside the Kubernetes cluster.


CNI Plugins:

CNI plugins must conform to the specifications set by the CNCF Container Network Interface Project.
Most CNIs are open-source software projects maintained by a community or a specific company.
A container network needs to assign IP addresses to pods to enable communication over a private network.

Examples of CNI Plugins:

Flannel: Provides a layer three IPv4 network between multiple nodes in a cluster but does not control how containers are networked to 
the host.
Cilium: Offers networking capabilities, observability, and security features. It extends the network to multiple Kubernetes clusters, 
enforces network policies, load balances between pods and external services, and can be configured as a service mesh.

Finding CNI Plugins:

The CNCF landscape, particularly the cloud-native network section, lists CNCF-sponsored CNI plugins such as Cilium, Flannel, Isovalent, 
Weave Net, and Calico.

Purpose of CNI Plugins in Kubernetes:

Create a network where containers and pods can communicate using TCP/IP.
Different CNI plugins offer varying levels of features, from basic communication setup (like Flannel) to more complex functionalities 
(like Cilium).
